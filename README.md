# publicdoename.github.io

This is to be a place for thoughts, audio examples, interviews?, video...

This is not currently open for contribution. This might change in the future, but for now this closed. I know this is an open-source platform but, for me, this project is about learning. In order to hit my target, I need to practice alone. 

Peace!
